{"body":"## [Image Processing toolbox](http://niru.org/imageprocessing/)\r\n\r\n**written by Niru Maheswaranathan (nirum@stanford.edu)**\r\n\r\nThis toolbox contains some useful scripts for generating and processing image ensembles in Matlab.\r\n\r\n***\r\n#### Setup\r\n1. This toolbox uses images from the van Hateren natural image database. Download the images from [the Bethge lab](http://bethgelab.org/datasets/vanhateren/). A mirror is also hosted by Paul Ivanov [at his website](http://pirsquared.org/research/vhatdb/).\r\n2. Specify the path to the image set you want to use (either the linearized .iml images or the deblurred, or calibrated, .imc images) in **setupIPT.m**\r\n3. Make sure to run **setupIPT.m** before using the toolbox. You can add the entire toolbox to your path using **pathtool** in Matlab.\r\n\r\n#### Requirements\r\nTo use the toolbox, you'll need a copy of Matlab. I haven't figured out exactly what versions are supported yet. It might also work with Octave.\r\n\r\n***\r\n#### List of functions\r\nSecondary helper functions included in the *helper_functions* folder are not included in this list.\r\n\r\n- **setupIPT.m** Sets up some paths for the imageprocessing toolbox (IPT). Run this before using the toolbox!\r\n- **generate_samples.m** Generates (or samples) image patches from different model classes (gaussian noise, pink noise, natural images, or the dead leaves model)\r\n- **loadimage.m** Loads an image from the van Hateren database\r\n- **oneoverf.m** Generates 1/f noise (from Lawrence Cormack)\r\n- **plot_patches.m** Plots rows of a matrix as images in a grid. Useful for visualizing the output of generate_samples.m\r\n- **downsample2.m** 2D downsampling function\r\n- **upsample2.m** 2D upsampling function\r\n- **gabor.m** Generates a 2D gabor function\r\n\r\n***\r\n#### License\r\nThis code is provided for non-commercial research use only. There are no guarantees that anything works, but let me know if something doesn't work and I will fix it.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
